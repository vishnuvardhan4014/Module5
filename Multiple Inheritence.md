# Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python

This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, and Division — using three classes.

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

## 💻 Program 
```
class Calculation1:
def Summation(self, a, b):
return a + b
class Calculation2:
def multi(self, a, b):
return a * b
class Derived(Calculation1, Calculation2):
def Division(self, a, b):
if b != 0:
return a / b
else:
return "Division by zero is not allowed"
num1 = float(input())
num2 = float(input())
obj = Derived()
sum_result = obj.Summation(num1, num2)
mul_result = obj.multi(num1, num2)
div_result = obj.Division(num1, num2)
print(sum_result)
print(mul_result)
print(div_result)
```
